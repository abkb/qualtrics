Thank you for taking the time (and mental effort) to provide us with your feedback on the best ways to conceptualize Historic Character &amp; Condition, Heritage Awareness, and Financial Benefits within the revised OptiPres Model we are constructing for Cape Lookout National Seashore.<br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In this exercise, we first ask you to assign the weights of each attribute (and corresponding sub-attributes) for the management objectives we set back in January (historic character &amp; integrity; heritage awareness; and financial benefits). You may want to refer to the handouts with the definitions that we attached to the email that contained the link to this survey.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Then, we will ask you to apply scores for each of the metrics that correspond to the attributes and sub-attributes. We provide examples of possible distances between each metric to assist you conceptualize possible differences between the metrics.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We are grateful for you help in refining the calculations for the decision model, which will represent your values. We plan to use the mean values and we will present the results at the next workshop (TBD).</div>
